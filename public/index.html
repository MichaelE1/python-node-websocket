    <h3>Python + Node.js + WebSocket</h3>
    <p>
      Recently I've been using Python to interact with hardware and IoT sensors.
      I wanted an easy way to pipe the data into a Node application. This
      example provides a simple structure for doing so. It could also be used
      for other domains in which Python is popular, such as machine learning.
    </p>
    <b>python/script.py</b>
    <p>
      A Python script that could be used for everything & anything. In this
      example it is a simple counter.
    </p>
    <b>app.js</b>
    <p>
      Creates a Node http server. Listens for clients connecting to the server.
      Sends the Python output to the client. Logs any messages received from the
      client. Uses
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws" target="_blank">ws</a>, a
      popular Node.js WebSocket library.
    </p>
    <b>public/js/client.js</b>
    <p>
      Connects to the WebSocket server. When a message is received, updates the
      page. If the number received is even, sends a response back to the server.
      Uses the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/joewalnes/reconnecting-websocket"
        target="_blank"
        >ReconnectingWebSocket</a
      >
      library to automatically reconnect if the connection is dropped.
    </p>
